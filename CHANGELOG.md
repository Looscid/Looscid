## Looscid 2026.109.29 (138): Round 6.2

Released October 10, 2026 at 10:33 AM (Eastern Time, 2026-10-10T14:33:35Z UTC)

A fix update: Looscid has its icon.

- Add to Home Screen on iPhone and Android shows the Looscid logo, a white L in a C ring on blue, named Looscid.
- The browser tab shows the logo too.
- Docs: NOSTR_ARCHITECTURE.md says Looscid instead of the old name DreamOS.
- Same words, sounds, pitch cues, settings, storage keys and accessibility.

## Looscid 2026.109.28 (137): Round 6.1

Released October 10, 2026 at 10:08 AM (Eastern Time, 2026-10-10T14:08:08Z UTC)

A fix update: nothing you see or hear changes.

- Looscid is split into files: index.html is only the frame, styles are in css/, and the code is in js/, one file per tab. FILES.md lists what lives where and the load order.
- Alerts and Discover are plain JavaScript with native HTML elements, no framework. The other tabs still use React and move over one at a time.
- Same words, sounds, pitch cues, settings, storage keys and accessibility. Settings backups from Round 6 import unchanged, and backups made now import into Round 6.

## Looscid 2026.109.27 (136): Round 6

Released October 10, 2026 at 8:41 AM (Eastern Time, 2026-10-10T12:41:40Z UTC)

- No extra descriptions: VoiceOver reads each control's name, role and state, and explanations are plain text under headings.
- Verbosity is a tab on Screen reader and braille.
- Apps are Looscid's own: Settings, Apps, and the Looscid App Store.
- Commandbar: the bar and full screen share one history.
- Alerts only for things that really happen, with settings for each.
- Louder sounds with a limiter, plus the Insomnia, NexOS and Hyper Synth packs.
- Privacy: sections that open one at a time, who can do what, Blocked and muted, Media and content.
- Reset: the last item in every settings list.
- Looscid checks for updates by itself and tells you when one is ready.
